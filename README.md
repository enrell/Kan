# Teseu - A Narrative-Driven AI Game

**Teseu** is a narrative-driven game where players engage in conversations with characters powered by local AI. The game features immersive dialogues generated by local inference, allowing each interaction to evolve based on the context.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Teseu blends artificial intelligence with interactive storytelling to deliver a truly offline experience where each player encounter feels personal and dynamic. Instead of relying on scripted dialogues, the characters you meet think for themselves — generating thoughts and speech through local AI models. Your choices shape not only the outcome of conversations, but also the emotional texture and direction of the world.

## 🎮 Key Features

* **Intelligent NPCs**: Characters that remember, reflect, and respond naturally.
* **Offline First**: The entire experience runs on your device — no internet required.
* **Narrative Exploration**: Walk through a world where dialogue is your main tool to uncover secrets, build relationships, and influence outcomes.
* **Philosophical Undertones**: Inspired by modern literature, identity paradoxes, and speculative fiction — the story asks what it means to be real, to change, and to choose.

## 🌍 The Journey Begins

In Teseu, conversation is not just a mechanic — it is the world. Every character you meet has a mind of their own. Speak with them, test their beliefs, shape their stories. You may not always find clear answers — but in this world, the questions are often more powerful.

A game where every word matters. A place where fiction thinks back.

Welcome to **Teseu**.
